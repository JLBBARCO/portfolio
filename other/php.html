    <p>
      PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used, open-source, server-side
      scripting language designed for web development. It allows developers to
      create dynamic and interactive web pages, process from data, manage
      sessions, and connect to databases. Essentially, it is the engine that
      powers many websites, enabling them to respond to user actions and display
      changing content.
