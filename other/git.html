    <p>
      Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track
      changes to their code during software development. It allows multiple
      developers to collaborate on the same project, manage different versions
      of code, and easily revert to previous states. Essentially, it is a tool
      for managing code history facilitating teamwork.
