    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, programming
      language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is primarily
      used to create interactive web content and is one of the core technologies
      of the World Wide Web alongside HTML and CSS. While historically used for
      client-side scripts in web browsers, JavaScript can also be used for
      server-side development with platforms like Node.js.
