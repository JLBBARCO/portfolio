    <p>
      Arduino is an open-source platform used for building eletronics projects.
      It consist of both a physical programmable circuit board ( a
      microcontroller ) and a piece of software ( an IDE ) used to write and
      upload code to the board. Arduino allows users to create interactive
      objects and envirenments by programming the microcontroller to interact
      with various sensors, motors, and other eletronic components.
